# KahootBots
This is a project I'll work on from time to time for setting up the best kahoot bots

CREDITS FOR THE IDEA AND CODE: Kahootbot.org, CPScript, Raymo111

A Kahoot bot spammer written in python, I will containerize it and a web interface for it so that anyone can host it on a website themself alongside a desktop app to host them on your own machine
I'm still learning python and don't have much time so once I get this going contributions are greatly appreciated
